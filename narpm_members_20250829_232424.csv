"<p>Working in residential real estate for over 20 years, I have often found myself representing tenants who are lost and exhausted. Trying to set up showings on rental properties and getting no response from listing agents; combing through the MLS and seeing page after page of poorly marketed listings and wrong or incomplete information; discovering loads of inconsistencies in the application and leasing process - it is not hard to imagine how overwhelming the process must feel to a prospective tenant, especially those that are relocating from out of the area.</p><p>On the landlord side, I have seen countless property owners failing to maximize their investments - securing leases at below market rental rates, having to trudge through the eviction process for lease violations and non-payment of rent and tired of answering the phone at all hours for repair requests. I often get calls from investors with underperforming properties they are just looking to offload because they are tired of the headaches.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 17.6px"">The idea to open a property management division was not a new one. Over the last few years since I have been back in the DC area, I have executed over 75 leases - I was shocked when I actually pulled a report! I have always helped my past clients run an analysis when they are considering selling a property to determine if perhaps holding onto it as a rental makes sense. I have made a lot of property owners first-time landlords and walked them through the process of self-management, property marketing and tenant procurement. And I was always the one that got the calls with questions for recommended vendors and solutions to common landlord issues. It seemed like a natural progression to create a full-service property management company. I look forward to serving my clients at an even higher level.</span></p><p>I began my real estate career in 2001 working for a production builder. One could say I fell into real estate completely by accident and learned to embrace it! I have worked in Austin and Dallas, Texas, for several years, but got licensed in DC, Maryland and Virginia in 2005. Cumulatively, I have now been in the DC Metro area for over half my career! I have my Associate Broker’s license, am a Certified Residential Specialist and a Military Relocation Professional.</p><p>Aside from my real estate career, I wear a few other hats - baseball wife, girl mom, dog lover, community resource and philanthropist. My husband Andrew and I live in Rockville and own an investment condo in North Bethesda. When I’m not slinging houses, you can probably find us cheering on our favorite sports teams in the DMV (go Nationals, Capitals and DC United - we can just agree to disagree on football), volunteering with a local nonprofit organization or checking out a new restaurant!

"<p>I am originally from Phoenix, AZ but have been in Tucson the majority of the time. I am a single mother of three boys and I currently have three dogs. I have worked in various aspects of real estate since 2001. I have experience in such roles as title secretary, customer service coordinator for a builder, customer service manager for a builder, a marketing/salesperson for another real estate brokerage, and a property manager for 15 years. Although I enjoy property management, the brokerage I was working for did not do sales at all. So, I decided to leave that position to open my own brokerage so that I could do both sales and property management. I opened Mac's Pro RE in October of 2020 - during the worst of the worst - the Covid pandemic.<br><br>In working in management, I found a desperate need to have a cleaner/maintenance person on hand to help with properties when I was in a pinch. So, in 2016 I opened MACS Maintenance And Cleaning Services. Having my own maintenance and cleaning company has been extremely helpful in getting minor repairs and cleaning done on my rentals quickly, efficiently and affordably.<br><br>In my spare time - not that I have much - I enjoy doing anything and everything with my boys. I have been a team mom for about 20 years now in just about every sport - soccer, baseball, basketball, flag football, and tackle football. I volunteer much of my time to the Tucson Youth Football and Spirit Federation as I am a Board Member on the Wildcat Youth Football League.

"<p>Coldwell Banker Residential Property Management operates with the backing of over 40 years of Coldwell Banker’s leadership in Lubbock, Texas. As a recognized gold standard in real estate brokerage, Coldwell Banker has built a legacy of professionalism, integrity, and excellence in the region. Since 2006, Coldwell Banker Residential Property Management has continued that tradition by delivering high-quality property management services tailored to both single-family and multifamily markets. Our commitment to “doing the right thing” underpins every aspect of our operations, ensuring that we act in the best interest of both property owners and tenants. This focus on long-term relationships and ethical management has established us as a trusted partner for institutional investors and individual property owners alike.</p><h2><strong>CORE COMPETENCIES</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Integrated Management Approach:</strong><br>Leveraging our extensive experience in multifamily management, we apply the same proven systems and strategies to the SFR market. This includes centralized maintenance coordination, advanced leasing technology, and tenant retention programs, ensuring that even large-scale SFR portfolios are managed with the same operational efficiency as multifamily complexes. Conversely, we incorporate key SFR practices—such as personalized tenant engagement and flexible property marketing—into our multifamily management, enhancing tenant satisfaction and lease-up rates.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Single Family Rental (SFR) Portfolio Management:</strong><br>Specializing in managing large SFR portfolios for institutional investors, we provide comprehensive services, from initial lease-up to long-term maintenance and tenant retention. Owners with extensive portfolios, some valued at over $5 million, have entrusted us to grow their assets while optimizing returns and maintaining high standards of service.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multifamily (MF) Management:</strong><br>With over 400 multifamily units under management, we employ a hybrid management model that combines on-site managers with corporate oversight. Our team manages multiple sites efficiently while ensuring each property receives tailored attention. We use technology and hands-on experience to streamline operations, improve communication, and reduce vacancy rates.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND SUPPORT</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Portfolio Growth:</strong><br>Proven track record of guiding investors from single-property ownership to large-scale portfolios. Our services extend to providing strategic advice on acquisitions, lease audits, and portfolio expansion. We ensure that investment decisions are backed by local market knowledge and long-term profitability analysis.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cross-Application of SFR and MF Concepts:</strong><br>Our management philosophy emphasizes a two-way exchange of best practices between SFR and MF management. From SFR, we bring personalized tenant engagement and neighborhood-level management strategies to our MF properties. Conversely, from MF, we bring centralized maintenance, advanced technology integration, and structured leasing processes to SFR portfolios, ensuring that both asset classes benefit from a hybrid approach that maximizes efficiency and tenant satisfaction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tailored SFR Management Approach:</strong><br>While our approach to SFR portfolios mirrors the successful principles of multifamily management—centralized operations, rigorous maintenance, and strategic tenant placement—we also understand that SFR properties require flexibility. We tailor our management to enhance the unique aspects of SFR, such as providing more autonomy to tenants, implementing community-driven marketing strategies, and focusing on tenant retention within neighborhoods.</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Quarterly Inspections &amp; Maintenance:</strong><br>All properties, whether SFR or multifamily, are subject to quarterly inspections, where we replace AC filters, check smoke detectors, and assess the need for preventive maintenance. Each inspection is thoroughly documented with photographs, ensuring transparency for owners and maintaining property value.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Technology-Driven Management:</strong><br>We employ cutting-edge self-showing technology and communication systems to maximize leasing efficiency and tenant satisfaction. Tenants use our portal for rent payments and service requests, while owners benefit from detailed financial reporting and real-time data access through customizable online portals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seamless Transitions:</strong><br>Our team is highly experienced in transitioning SFR and multifamily portfolios with minimal disruption to tenants. Single-family home transitions are typically completed within two weeks, while multifamily transitions are managed within 30-45 days. Throughout, we prioritize tenant retention and operational continuity.</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Coldwell Banker Residential Property Management works closely with residential brokers, developers, and investment groups, providing deep insights into the unique opportunities available in mid-market regions like Lubbock. Our comprehensive support enables institutional investors to navigate market conditions, streamline operations, and maximize returns on both SFR and multifamily investments.</p></li></ul>",Lubbock,Coldwell Banker,[''],1200,Oscar,,2012,Armendariz II,842087949,[],"['Lubbock, TX', 'Andrews, TX']",806-784-3290,"['Single Family', 'Multi Family']",TX,4920 S.

"I was born and raised in the small southwest Florida beachfront town of Englewood where I have been a resident for most of my life. After high school I received my college education in Orlando at the University of Central Florida. During my stint in Orlando I earned in addition to a Bachelors of Science in Marketing, my real estate and mortgage brokers license. Although I learned much from class and graduated with high marks, I believe the true worth of my education was in the networking and friends I made during college. Since graduation, I have returned to southwest Florida to reside in the city of Englewood with my beautiful wife, two sons and daughter. We have always loved this area not only due to the beaches, but more importantly our family and friends are here. I chose a career in real estate, or perhaps it chose me, I am not really sure anymore. I started off as a real estate sales agent which quickly blossomed into many exciting opportunities, including being a broker and owner of RE/MAX Palm Realty. My real estate ventures include ownership in Palm Realty Property Management a full service property management company, Palm Realty of Southwest Florida a rapid home renovation entity, SHIFT Real Estate Enterprises a rental holding company, Gulfcoast Insurance Team focused on providing consumers with homeowners insurance, Palm Realty Referral Services a referral agent brokerage and The Platinum Team a real estate sales group connecting Buyers with Sellers.

"Joel has worked in property management for nearly 20 years.  Starting as a teenager, he worked for a local broker turning rental houses and handling work orders submitted by tenants.  Using that experience, he began in property management starting in 2006 handling leasing, management, unit turns and work orders for single family and small multi-family properties.  By 2012, he had been promoted to a Senior Vice President and Partner in his firm, and was involved in asset management for large multi-family properties and portfolios.  He developed a knack for repositioning troubled assets, cutting costs and improving cash flow by growing revenue and reducing expenses.  He handled properties throughout the southeast, and many of the assets he managed grew in value to be sold for very high returns.  In 2016, he earned the Certified Property Manager designation, and is one of just a small handful in the Augusta Georgia market.  Today he continues to manage large assets, many single family homes and a large department of property managers for his firm providing top level management services to all of his clients.

"Waypoint Residential Management was started by Shannyn Flory, whose vast experience in the real estate industry began in 1992 and has encompassed the areas of title and escrow, lending, home appraising, investing, property management and sales. In 2003, after several years as a property manager, she created an electronically formatted How-To guide to property management and launched The Complete Landlord E-Guide along with an interactive companion website called The Landlords Resource Directory. Her experience led her into work as a Landlord Coach and accounting consultant for other property managers. Years later, after much success is real estate sales, the need for a new type of property management service emerged in the wake of the real estate crash. The sophisticated brand strategy for Waypoint Residential Management was developed by Shannyn in 2009 to assist property owners looking to hold on to their homes until the real estate market could recover.

"Growing up in the shadow of an experienced entrepreneur, John witnessed firsthand the dedication and effort it took to successfully compete in real estate and development.

Quickly applying similar layout methods and finishes implemented in developing east end homes on Long Island, coupled with fortuitous timing of downstate migration north, a new trajectory took off rapidly and came together as JMS Construction. The companys rapid success in renovation, construction supervision and property management was attained by continued streamlining of processes along with strategic acquisitions.

She has closed an incredibly high percentage of those transactions with 100% satisfaction. For Emily, the size of the sale doesnt matter. Her goal is to ensure 100% satisfaction for her clients. Emily loves to work with people from all over the world.<BR><BR>Emily is professionally trending toward commercial real estate. Her ability to understand current market conditions and anticipate future market trends has made her an invaluable asset to her clients.

"I grew up in Southern California and moved to Colorado in 2008. I started driving school busses in 2009 and then semi trucks by 2011. I was able to team drive with my husband of 10 years, Greg, and we covered a lot of road. It was an experience I was fortunate to have. I was still driving when the opportunity of becoming a property manager came up. The previous manager thought I would be good at it and I met with the owners in the 104 townhome complex and here I am. I wanted to make sure to join an organization that encourages, assists and teach how to be a better property manager.",Thornton,BMC Enterprises,[''],0,Bonnie,,0,Cochran,842105225,[],[],303-642-5273,[],CO,3991 E 121st Ave,
