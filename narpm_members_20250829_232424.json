      "about": "Born in San Francisco, Raised in Sacramento, I&#39;ve found my niche with Property Management in the Sacramento and Placer County areas. Licensed in two states &#40;California & Nevada&#41; as both a realtor and a Property Manager &#40;Nevada requires a separate test/license&#41; for nearly 20 years, my experience has lead to only taking referrals for my leads with no marketing or advertising necessary. With only two evictions, I pride myself on taking time at the front with the application processing so that the owner and I aren&#39;t paying at the end with a bad experience.<BR><BR>NARPM is an invaluable resource .. and I love the edge it gives a property manager, particularly with the designations. I finally got my Master Property Manager designation and am happy to see it does set you apart. Highly recommend!",

With two locations managing over 1000+ properties, Kayla takes immense pride in her diverse team representing three different countries. She believes exceptional customer service drives success in property management and advocates for more human connection, urging everyone to “pick up the phone and talk to people!” Known as the self-proclaimed Queen of Getting 1-Star Reviews Removed, she’s passionate about creating outstanding resident experiences and can’t stand when tenants decide to move out. Outside of work, Kayla trains for triathlons and will never answer a call on a Friday as she's usually on two wheels. A NARPM member for eight years, Kayla joined the organization after being inspired (and slightly terrified) by Monica Gilroy’s eye-opening litigation stories, which fueled her commitment to staying educated and prepared in her field. Over the past four years, she has been a dedicated member of the NARPM Board of Directors and was named the NARPM National Volunteer of the Year in 2023. Known for her ability to throw unforgettable parties that bring people together, Kayla’s mission goes beyond the events—she’s passionate about creating a sense of belonging, ensuring every NARPM member feels valued and appreciated.</span></p>",

I established my company in 2012 and began renting office space for my business in downtown Hanover to provide a professional appearance for my tenants, even though I was only managing my own properties. In 2013 I decided to get my real estate license, and in 2017 received my broker&#39;s license, enabling me to manage properties for other investors through my company.",

      "about": "Chris Turner has been investing in real estate since 1993. He began buying and renting homes while stationed in Alaska with the US Air Force. Originally from Greenville, SC he decided to move back to South Carolina and settled in the Columbia area. He began purchasing rental properties and handled the management, maintenance and screening of tenants himself. Over the years hes learned many lessons while managing his own real estate investments. Chris applies the lessons hes learned to keep his clients from making those same mistakes.<BR><BR>While he was with Century 21 Bob Capes realtors he worked with homebuyers and sellers helping them navigate the sometimes complicated world of real estate. He also headed up a new commercial office development in Northeast Columbia.<BR><BR>Chris decided to start his own real estate company in the hopes of being better positioned to serve his clients. Beginning in 2008 we opened our doors with just 1 client who owned 4 units. Today we manage over 200 units throughout the Midlands. We believe this rapid growth is due to our personal service and attention to detail.<BR><BR>In the past few years he has shifted the companys focus primarily to property management. Chris has attended numerous classes and seminars regarding rental management and currently has the Residential Management Professional designation from the National Association of Residential Property Managers &#40;NARPM&#41;. There are very few agents with this designation in the market. The RMP designation requires online and classroom education, 100 unit years of experience managing residential real estate, letters of recommendation from current designation holders and clients and volunteer service to NARPM.",

Most of my adult life has been spent living and working in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">My career began in 1999 with commercial real estate broker, Colliers Monroe Friedlander. I transitioned to residential real estate in 2001 when I joined Prudential Locations. I actively engaged in real estate investing between 2000 and 2015, acquiring eight residential properties in Honolulu with a combined 14 rental units.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">Taking advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I worked as the Executive Vice President&nbsp; and eventually President &amp; CEO of Century 21 Brazil Real Estate. In this role I was instrumental in introducing the iconic global brand to the Brazilian market, opening more than 120 independently owned and operated franchises in 20 states and the Federal District between 2008-2014. Much of my time in Brasil was spent implementing best practices and marketing techniques throughout our franchise system. During this time I learned Portuguese, married, and to this day speak both languages fluently, although my Portuguese is getting rusty.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">They say you can take the boy from the island but not the island from the boy, and this was certainly true in my case. After seven years living between Sao Paulo and Honolulu, I grew homesick for our island lifestyle and working at the brokerage level, so I returned home in 2014, reactivated my Hawaii real estate broker’s license (RB-18853), and began working as the Principal Broker of Hawaii Sands Realty in 2015.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">I am grateful to live in our beautiful islands and truly enjoy helping my clients to buy, sell, and professionally manage what are often their most valuable investment(s) and, by doing so, ensuring that quality long-term housing is available for our island residents.</p>",

      "about": "<p>Working in residential real estate for over 20 years, I have often found myself representing tenants who are lost and exhausted. Trying to set up showings on rental properties and getting no response from listing agents; combing through the MLS and seeing page after page of poorly marketed listings and wrong or incomplete information; discovering loads of inconsistencies in the application and leasing process - it is not hard to imagine how overwhelming the process must feel to a prospective tenant, especially those that are relocating from out of the area.</p><p>On the landlord side, I have seen countless property owners failing to maximize their investments - securing leases at below market rental rates, having to trudge through the eviction process for lease violations and non-payment of rent and tired of answering the phone at all hours for repair requests. I often get calls from investors with underperforming properties they are just looking to offload because they are tired of the headaches.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 17.6px\">The idea to open a property management division was not a new one. Over the last few years since I have been back in the DC area, I have executed over 75 leases - I was shocked when I actually pulled a report! I have always helped my past clients run an analysis when they are considering selling a property to determine if perhaps holding onto it as a rental makes sense. I have made a lot of property owners first-time landlords and walked them through the process of self-management, property marketing and tenant procurement. And I was always the one that got the calls with questions for recommended vendors and solutions to common landlord issues. It seemed like a natural progression to create a full-service property management company. I look forward to serving my clients at an even higher level.</span></p><p>I began my real estate career in 2001 working for a production builder. One could say I fell into real estate completely by accident and learned to embrace it! I have worked in Austin and Dallas, Texas, for several years, but got licensed in DC, Maryland and Virginia in 2005. Cumulatively, I have now been in the DC Metro area for over half my career! I have my Associate Broker’s license, am a Certified Residential Specialist and a Military Relocation Professional.</p><p>Aside from my real estate career, I wear a few other hats - baseball wife, girl mom, dog lover, community resource and philanthropist. My husband Andrew and I live in Rockville and own an investment condo in North Bethesda. When I’m not slinging houses, you can probably find us cheering on our favorite sports teams in the DMV (go Nationals, Capitals and DC United - we can just agree to disagree on football), volunteering with a local nonprofit organization or checking out a new restaurant! We love to spend time in our community and that is the main reason I am limiting my property management services to the lower MoCo area.</p>",

Bisbee is a small town of just under 5,000 people. However, we are only about 30 miles east of Sierra Vista, Fort Huachuca, 30 miles northwest from Douglas, about 30 miles south of Tombstone, and between&nbsp; 100 and 120 miles from Tucson. Lots of things to do in this area of Arizona, history, hiking, bicycling, nature, birding, Bisbee is one mile high, so temperatures are more pleasant in the summer, however a few degrees cooler in the winter than Tucson or Phoenix..</p>",

      "about": "<p>My story starts in Georgetown, TX when I moved there in 2002, heeding the call of God (through government orders by the Army). At the time, I was a Military Intelligence officer coming back from serving almost 4 years in Germany with two deployments under my belt. I expected to finish off my commitment to the Army, marry my college sweetheart and then get a decent job wearing anything but the color green! However, God had different plans for me and a few months after marrying Autumn, I deployed with the 4th Infantry Division and my commitment to active duty was automatically extended. While sitting in one of Saddam Husseins bombed out palaces in Baghdad, God began to grow a desire in my heart to pursue a career in Real Estate. In October 2003, I finished my online classes and turned in my license for worldwide travel for a license to practice real estate in the state of Texas!<br><br>Six years after I was honorably discharged from the Army, I created my own real estate company, Mars Hill Realty Group and we now manage over 500 properties in Northern Virginia and Central Texas (Austin).&nbsp; We are a full service property management company and would love to help you grow your real estate portfolio and make it hassle-free!</p>",

Over time, I took on more responsibility, eventually purchasing the company and expanding it, which later led to the founding of separate commercial and vacation rental management companies. My efforts in strategic partnerships, marketing initiatives, and targeted acquisitions have been crucial in developing successful real estate management and ancillary service firms, particularly in Beaufort and Jasper Counties.</span><br><br><span style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9); font-size: 14px\">Real estate investing is more than just a job to me; it's a passion.

With a sharp business sense and an eye for opportunities, I'm looking forward to continuing to contribute to the commercial real estate investment sector for many years to come.</span></p>",

      "about": "<p>I am originally from Phoenix, AZ but have been in Tucson the majority of the time. I am a single mother of three boys and I currently have three dogs. I have worked in various aspects of real estate since 2001. I have experience in such roles as title secretary, customer service coordinator for a builder, customer service manager for a builder, a marketing/salesperson for another real estate brokerage, and a property manager for 15 years. Although I enjoy property management, the brokerage I was working for did not do sales at all. So, I decided to leave that position to open my own brokerage so that I could do both sales and property management. I opened Mac's Pro RE in October of 2020 - during the worst of the worst - the Covid pandemic.<br><br>In working in management, I found a desperate need to have a cleaner/maintenance person on hand to help with properties when I was in a pinch. So, in 2016 I opened MACS Maintenance And Cleaning Services. Having my own maintenance and cleaning company has been extremely helpful in getting minor repairs and cleaning done on my rentals quickly, efficiently and affordably.<br><br>In my spare time - not that I have much - I enjoy doing anything and everything with my boys. I have been a team mom for about 20 years now in just about every sport - soccer, baseball, basketball, flag football, and tackle football. I volunteer much of my time to the Tucson Youth Football and Spirit Federation as I am a Board Member on the Wildcat Youth Football League. I have done everything from field setup, team mom, business manager, event assistance, fundraising, registration, field marshall, and I am currently responsible for running the snack bar!</p>",

      "about": "<p>Coldwell Banker Residential Property Management operates with the backing of over 40 years of Coldwell Banker’s leadership in Lubbock, Texas. As a recognized gold standard in real estate brokerage, Coldwell Banker has built a legacy of professionalism, integrity, and excellence in the region. Since 2006, Coldwell Banker Residential Property Management has continued that tradition by delivering high-quality property management services tailored to both single-family and multifamily markets. Our commitment to “doing the right thing” underpins every aspect of our operations, ensuring that we act in the best interest of both property owners and tenants. This focus on long-term relationships and ethical management has established us as a trusted partner for institutional investors and individual property owners alike.</p><h2><strong>CORE COMPETENCIES</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Integrated Management Approach:</strong><br>Leveraging our extensive experience in multifamily management, we apply the same proven systems and strategies to the SFR market. This includes centralized maintenance coordination, advanced leasing technology, and tenant retention programs, ensuring that even large-scale SFR portfolios are managed with the same operational efficiency as multifamily complexes. Conversely, we incorporate key SFR practices—such as personalized tenant engagement and flexible property marketing—into our multifamily management, enhancing tenant satisfaction and lease-up rates.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Single Family Rental (SFR) Portfolio Management:</strong><br>Specializing in managing large SFR portfolios for institutional investors, we provide comprehensive services, from initial lease-up to long-term maintenance and tenant retention. Owners with extensive portfolios, some valued at over $5 million, have entrusted us to grow their assets while optimizing returns and maintaining high standards of service.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multifamily (MF) Management:</strong><br>With over 400 multifamily units under management, we employ a hybrid management model that combines on-site managers with corporate oversight. Our team manages multiple sites efficiently while ensuring each property receives tailored attention. We use technology and hands-on experience to streamline operations, improve communication, and reduce vacancy rates.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND SUPPORT</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Portfolio Growth:</strong><br>Proven track record of guiding investors from single-property ownership to large-scale portfolios. Our services extend to providing strategic advice on acquisitions, lease audits, and portfolio expansion. We ensure that investment decisions are backed by local market knowledge and long-term profitability analysis.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cross-Application of SFR and MF Concepts:</strong><br>Our management philosophy emphasizes a two-way exchange of best practices between SFR and MF management. From SFR, we bring personalized tenant engagement and neighborhood-level management strategies to our MF properties. Conversely, from MF, we bring centralized maintenance, advanced technology integration, and structured leasing processes to SFR portfolios, ensuring that both asset classes benefit from a hybrid approach that maximizes efficiency and tenant satisfaction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tailored SFR Management Approach:</strong><br>While our approach to SFR portfolios mirrors the successful principles of multifamily management—centralized operations, rigorous maintenance, and strategic tenant placement—we also understand that SFR properties require flexibility. We tailor our management to enhance the unique aspects of SFR, such as providing more autonomy to tenants, implementing community-driven marketing strategies, and focusing on tenant retention within neighborhoods.</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Quarterly Inspections &amp; Maintenance:</strong><br>All properties, whether SFR or multifamily, are subject to quarterly inspections, where we replace AC filters, check smoke detectors, and assess the need for preventive maintenance. Each inspection is thoroughly documented with photographs, ensuring transparency for owners and maintaining property value.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Technology-Driven Management:</strong><br>We employ cutting-edge self-showing technology and communication systems to maximize leasing efficiency and tenant satisfaction. Tenants use our portal for rent payments and service requests, while owners benefit from detailed financial reporting and real-time data access through customizable online portals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seamless Transitions:</strong><br>Our team is highly experienced in transitioning SFR and multifamily portfolios with minimal disruption to tenants. Single-family home transitions are typically completed within two weeks, while multifamily transitions are managed within 30-45 days. Throughout, we prioritize tenant retention and operational continuity.</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Coldwell Banker Residential Property Management works closely with residential brokers, developers, and investment groups, providing deep insights into the unique opportunities available in mid-market regions like Lubbock. Our comprehensive support enables institutional investors to navigate market conditions, streamline operations, and maximize returns on both SFR and multifamily investments.</p></li></ul>",

      "about": "Matt Williams was initially licensed as an Oregon Real Estate Broker in 2001 after moving to Portland in 1996. He began his education in real estate by representing buyers and sellers in the Portland-Metro area. His goal was, and remains, to save his clients more money than they spend on commissions. His skill set in negotiation and communication is his primary area of expertise which leads to the benefits his clients experience.<BR><BR>In 2005 he then became licensed as a Principal Broker and obtained his Washington State real estate license. This enabled him to supervise other brokers and start a property management division to service this portion of his clients. He began developing the systems and strategies necessary to appropriately manage the homes and small multi-family properties owned by his client base. He opened his own full-service brokerage in 2009.<BR><BR>Matt served as the 2015 National Association of Residential Property Managers&#39; &#40;NARPM&#41;, Portland-Chapter President and earned his Residential Management Professional &#40;RMP&#41; designation through this national association. Matt also earned his Certified Apartment Manager &#40;CAM&#41; designation in 2015 through the National Apartment Association &#40;NAA&#41;.<BR><BR>In 2017, Matt brought his investor clients and real estate sales team over and joined the Garcia Group. Now at Garcia Group Real Estate Services, he runs the real estate sales division and advises clients on their income properties and real estate investment strategies. This has freed him up to spend more time with his clients directly and working on their overall investment portfolio growth and strategic purchases.",

Prior to 2005, he spent 25 years in the educational and faith-based non-profit world. He has served as a K-8 school principal, taught at the prep school and university levels, and as a consultant completed major strategic planning and fundraising campaigns for private schools, church communities, small businesses and non-profits throughout our region. He now uses these skills to lead Olympia Rentals. His education includes a BA Public Administration, Seattle University; studies in far eastern history and K-12 Ed Certification, Seattle University; MA Educational Leadership, University of Washington and post masters studies in leadership, University of Washington.

      "about": "The Luker family moved from Bristol, England, to Orlando in 1994, and in 2006, Jack Lukers father, Geoff, and his brother, Tom, founded Luker Properties Group &#40;LPG&#41;. After graduating from University of West Florida in 2009, Jack knew immediately that he wanted to join the family business. Fortified with a bachelors degree in hospitality and resort management, he obtained his real estate license and established the property management division of LPG in 2010 to broaden its offering. To that end, he is a certified community association manager &#40;CAM&#41;.<BR><BR>Growing up, Jack and his tightly knit family did everything together  including traveling and managing their many rental properties. Jack feels that the familys enterprise and international experience have instilled in him an ability to serve clients of diverse nationalities with a high degree of empathy and understanding. He views real estate not only as a local endeavor but also from a global perspective. Clients know Jack as the person they can count on to help  during the transaction and beyond. He is driven by a passion for serving others and believes in treating clients like family.<BR><BR>In his leisure time, Jack, like his brother, Tom, is a great fan of soccer. For more than a decade, he has been an assistant soccer coach at Oviedo High School, near Orlando. Hes also passionate about volunteering and raising funds for the ALS Therapy Development Institute, which does laboratory research on the disease that took his father in 2019. Jack and Tom have also established a charity golf tournament named in honor of their father.",

      "about": "I was born and raised in the small southwest Florida beachfront town of Englewood where I have been a resident for most of my life. After high school I received my college education in Orlando at the University of Central Florida. During my stint in Orlando I earned in addition to a Bachelors of Science in Marketing, my real estate and mortgage brokers license. Although I learned much from class and graduated with high marks, I believe the true worth of my education was in the networking and friends I made during college. Since graduation, I have returned to southwest Florida to reside in the city of Englewood with my beautiful wife, two sons and daughter. We have always loved this area not only due to the beaches, but more importantly our family and friends are here. I chose a career in real estate, or perhaps it chose me, I am not really sure anymore. I started off as a real estate sales agent which quickly blossomed into many exciting opportunities, including being a broker and owner of RE/MAX Palm Realty. My real estate ventures include ownership in Palm Realty Property Management a full service property management company, Palm Realty of Southwest Florida a rapid home renovation entity, SHIFT Real Estate Enterprises a rental holding company, Gulfcoast Insurance Team focused on providing consumers with homeowners insurance, Palm Realty Referral Services a referral agent brokerage and The Platinum Team a real estate sales group connecting Buyers with Sellers. I have met many people and learned much in this industry, so no matter what it is, from needing a plumber to a real estate attorney, I can point you in the right direction if not assist you directly.<BR>",

At first I turned over the management of the properties to a manager. As time went on I decided to take a more active role in the day to day management. By doing this and attending REIA Meetings I learned to manage my rental property investments. By hiring legal assistance I was able to lower the taxes by two thirds and by putting all of the properties under a commercial insurance policy I was able to cut my expenses significantly.<BR><BR>My wife, Jennifer, and I decided to sell the properties and move to a warmer climate. We were able to do so rather quickly. We decided on Southwest Florida. We ought an All County Property Management Franchise and opened our doors in 2013. We joined NARPM shortly afterward and became aboard member in 2015. In 2016 I was elected president of the Southwest Florida Chapter of NARPM.",

My history of performance as an aggressive leader in a variety of Real Estate fields with a reference list of those who have seen my proven track record is something i am very proud of. I trained a team of portfolio managers throughout Chicago. Simultaneously, I began project management in new construction, and implemented a leasing division to oversee a complete lease up that was soon quickly occupied. It was then that myself and my partner Matthew Martin formed AQM. With a more hands on experience in residential sales and property management growing under our belt while also growing a larger portfolio, we have taken our pro-active approach to streamlined management and sales in the single family sector to the next level-each investor at a time. We started working with investor groups to merge and purchase assets. This has provided jobs within our communities here in New Mexico, and allowed for us to perform hands on training which has brought continued success among those we work with to lead prosperous lives.<BR><BR>I have contributed to AQM Property Management&#39;s success as a multi-faceted real estate company that specializes in third party management, acquisition, improvement, and disposition of numerous single family residences for investors within numerous small to large sized portfolios.",

I opened my own company in October of 2020 New Day Property Management\". Yes, in the middle of a pandemic when I couldnt even do showings because everything was shut down. But it was a great opportunity and I was determined to succeed. 1 year later and at the tail end of this horrible pandemic I&#39;ve weathered the storm and my business has grown! I currently manage 50+ doors and I&#39;m looking to grow by 8-10 doors a year or more should the opportunity arise. I provide full service management in addition to a lease only service that not a lot of other managers offer. I&#39;m very hands on making sure all aspects of management are being handled with the highest of standards and integrity for my clients and tenants. I currently serve on our local NARPM Board as the Social Committee Chair, and I&#39;m an active member of the Colorado Landlord Legislative Coalition and the Council of Elite Property Managers.",

Quickly realizing she wanted more, she became licensed as a Realtor and began managing more and more of her clients investment properties but still couldn&#39;t get enough. NARPM was the obvious next choice for her insatiable appetite for education and industry best practices. She joined and hasn&#39;t missed many meetings since! She has served her NARPM community in many positions including Chapter Secretary, Chapter President twice and now as the current Phoenix Metro Chapter Treasurer. Erin is passionate about sharing knowledge and promoting good business practices among her colleagues.

Erin is a pro at playing as hard as she works and enjoys all things outdoors. She especially enjoys time with her family camping, fishing, cabining and road tripping every chance possible! Erin and her husband, Donnie, have also owned an Arizona based HVAC & remodeling company, Crescent Mechanical LLC, since 2015 which allows her to have an even better perspective on investment property maintenance. Erin along with her family are very proud supporters of all first responders and have a son in the US Marines.",

Because of company policy that I could not list, sell and also be the Property Manager, I resigned from Long&#39;s Property Management in November 1999.  at which time I continued to list and sell real estate with Long for another eight years.<BR><BR>Upon the loving support and urging from realtors, family, and past clients, I happily opened my own full-service Real Estate Company: Preference Properties, LLC in January 2008 so that I once again have the ability to offer Professional Property Management along with listing and selling real estate.<BR><BR> I have served in several positions on the Board of Realtors throughout the years:<BR><BR>Current President of Southeast Arizona Association of Realtors<BR><BR>SVAAR Education & Grievance Committees & Chairperson<BR>Regional Grievance Committee Member<BR>Director for the Board of Realtors &#40;several terms&#41;<BR>SAAR Board of Realtors Treasurer<BR>2004 SAAR Realtor of The Year<BR>Real Wishes Committee Member and Worker Bee<BR><BR>Community Service:<BR><BR>Long Realty Cares Foundation Board of Directors:  2001 to Feb",

      "about": "We at Whittington Group Realty, specializing in selling residential, investment properties and property management. As a full time Brokerage we are always ready and excited to work on getting your property sold or finding you a dream home.  I have stood the test of time and  I am committed to being honest, fair and truthful in every real estate transaction I facilitate. Treating my clients the way I would expect to be treated is crucial to my success.  Currently REO Broker, Certified Property Management Specialist, Pricing Strategy Advisor Certification and a Licensed Real Estate Broker.  I personally have been in the Real Estate Business for aver 29 years.   The Whittington/Turner families have been part of Toledo for many years.  My grandparents on both sides of the family migrated to Toledo, Ohio back in the 1930&#39;s.   I graduated from E. L. Bowsher High School in 1989 and jumped into the real estate market in 1991 as a result of doing \"something different\".

      "about": "Jason Archer is a US military veteran that has been managing property for over ten years, holds an MBA in Operations Management, is the President of Experience Property Group, Inc., and the owner of the PMI East Lyme franchise. Prior to opening the local PMI office, Jason has dedicated his professional career to the service of others, both during his service to our country and in private business, as a leader in a Fortune 500 company. Combining formalized training with extensive real-world experience, Jason is now dedicated to building the local PMI brand and improving the property management experience for owners and investors.<BR><BR>Born and raised in Colorado, at 18 I joined the Air Force and served in Texas, Florida, Japan, and finally landed in New Jersey where I purchased a home and transitioned to civilian life. After bouncing around the east coast for work, I made the conscious decision to drop roots in East Lyme, CT. Over the past seven years, we have fallen in love with the area and community and opening a local PMI office was a no-brainer. Doing so meant that I could serve, not only those who live in, but also those that invest in southeastern Connecticut. Being able to give back to the community in a meaningful way is important to me, and one way Im doing that is by improving the way real estate services are delivered and improving customer experience.",

After 5 years as a PGA professional, Marcus started a golf marketing company setting up and managing golf events for corporations and individual groups.  He organized golf events not only in the Pinehurst area but all over the country.Marcus acquired his Real Estate Brokers license in 2005, and with his wife Cathy Larose they opened Weichert, Realtors- Larose and Company in February, 2006.  Then in February of 2013, Cathy and Marcus joined the Coldwell Banker Advantage Company.  Since then they have seen their company grow to be a highly successful and highly regarded Real Estate firm within Moore County.<BR><BR>Marcus started Sandhills Rentals, LLC, a full service Property Management Company in 2009 shortly after the real estate market crashed. Marcus saw the writing on the wall as homes were not selling, inventory was increasing and banks were not lending.  At that time he realized there was a true need to be a liaison for owners for the rental of their properties and there were only a few companies in the area that offered property management services. Sandhills Rentals, LLC is now one of the largest and most respected property management companies in Moore County.  In the past few years they have added Short Term Vacation Rental Management along with Commercial and Association Management to their list of services.",

Taking care of tenant problems and concerns keeps tenants happy and they therefore do not want to move as often.  This does not have to cost owners a lot of money, it simply requires us to be responsive to tenants needs or questions.  The second way to have successful owners is through communication with owners and tenants.  Both owners and tenants want to know what is happening, especially when a problem arises.  Customer service is our primary concern.",

      "about": "Joel has worked in property management for nearly 20 years.  Starting as a teenager, he worked for a local broker turning rental houses and handling work orders submitted by tenants.  Using that experience, he began in property management starting in 2006 handling leasing, management, unit turns and work orders for single family and small multi-family properties.  By 2012, he had been promoted to a Senior Vice President and Partner in his firm, and was involved in asset management for large multi-family properties and portfolios.  He developed a knack for repositioning troubled assets, cutting costs and improving cash flow by growing revenue and reducing expenses.  He handled properties throughout the southeast, and many of the assets he managed grew in value to be sold for very high returns.  In 2016, he earned the Certified Property Manager designation, and is one of just a small handful in the Augusta Georgia market.  Today he continues to manage large assets, many single family homes and a large department of property managers for his firm providing top level management services to all of his clients.  He is happily married and has four children, and enjoys spending time with his family and all things outdoors such as camping, biking, running, kayaking and hiking among other things.",

He was surrounded by a family of entrepreneurs who were selfless and always found opportunities to impart knowledge and deliver value to others. Fareed lives by guiding principles of trustworthiness, truthfulness and honesty, which could not be exchanged for a worldly gain or possession. Fareed has lived in the Springfield metropolitan area for most of his life, attended college at Westfield State University, and where he is proud to be raising his young family. Over the past 16+ years, he has established a career path in management, finance, and trainer positions with a Real Estate/ Parking Firm at their corporate headquarters located in Connecticut.<BR><BR>Fareed was introduced to the Property Management industry in 2007, which also marked the beginning of a long and interesting journey. He has since established strong relationships and alliances with local housing agencies, the housing court, law enforcement, and vendors over the span of 12+ years serving the Property Management industry.<BR><BR>After twelve years of serving a very dynamic industry, Fareed discovered his passion for real estate property management. In October 2019 he was compelled to start his company, and this was when Uniform Property Management went from a dream to reality. In his spare time, Fareed enjoys spending quality time with his wife and children, attending leadership workshops, listening to leadership and property management podcasts, playing tennis and biking.",

      "about": "Waypoint Residential Management was started by Shannyn Flory, whose vast experience in the real estate industry began in 1992 and has encompassed the areas of title and escrow, lending, home appraising, investing, property management and sales. In 2003, after several years as a property manager, she created an electronically formatted How-To guide to property management and launched The Complete Landlord E-Guide along with an interactive companion website called The Landlords Resource Directory. Her experience led her into work as a Landlord Coach and accounting consultant for other property managers. Years later, after much success is real estate sales, the need for a new type of property management service emerged in the wake of the real estate crash. The sophisticated brand strategy for Waypoint Residential Management was developed by Shannyn in 2009 to assist property owners looking to hold on to their homes until the real estate market could recover. Shannyns unique mission and commitment focuses on a premium level of customer service, catering to the specialized needs of high end residential properties and implementing management strategies for maximum property maintenance as a means to maintain property values. Shannyn also perceives and nurtures what she feels is an essential and natural partnership with the real estate sales community to exchange high quality referrals and provide interim leasing solutions in a continually changing housing environment.",

As a child, every Sunday my grandmother would gather us up and take us to a Spiritual Anglican Church. This early church experience developed a fire in me that had to be fueled.<BR><BR>When I came to New York city, I joined a Spiritual Baptist Church. I accepted Christ into my life here in 1998 and was baptized by water in 2001. It was not long before I realized spiritual gifts that God had provided me including charity, joy, peace, kindness, goodness, generosity, gentleness, faithfulness, modesty, and self-control. From running my own business to being part of a larger business, I recognized a call to lead.<BR>I would like to think I used the characteristics of a leader stated in 1 Timothy 3, of being above reproach, faithful to my spouse, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, and not a lover of money.<BR>With 10 years of experience in the industry, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to every client interaction.

This led him to specialize in converting DC row houses into multi-unit and group rental properties in the Washington, DC market. For Amit, there is something very satisfying about a tangible result of envisioning the design, aesthetics and functional skills needed to convert or renovate a property.<BR><BR>In Amits free time, he can be found touring Washington, D.C., awe-inspired by the energy and beauty of the city with its diverse neighborhoods, old character-filled row houses, impressive monuments and historical buildings. He also enjoys spending time family and friends, often skiing, scuba diving or biking.<BR><BR>A New Jersey native Amit received his MBA in Management and Finance from the Johns Hopkins University and his BA in Economics and Political Science from Emory University.<BR><BR>",

I attended a meeting on real estate investing in early 2002, purchased some real estate investment education to help me understand what I was getting into and I have not stopped learning about real estate from that day on. The best way to become successful in real estate investing is thru education, never stop learning, network with the people who are doing it right to see what really works in the market place and find you a good mentor. I was blessed to have found good education, a good network of investors and a great mentor to advise me and move me down the right path to success. Now I find no greater pleasure than to give back to those who wish to start their path to real estate investing and financial freedom.<BR><BR>I wish the best of business to all who dream the dream!<BR><BR>President of Solution Realty Network, Inc.<BR> May 2004 to present<BR><BR>",

      "about": "Andrew Johnston has spent his life perfecting the craft of representing others. Beginning his professional life in the retail environment, his number one take away from that experience is that it is paramount to learn ABOUT your client before you have any hopes of assisting them with any purchase. Very few people make larger purchases in their lifetime than that of their home, and the mindset of learning about your client, and putting the client&#39;s needs ahead of one&#39;s own, is found few and far between in agents today. Working with any home buyer or seller is a privilege and should be treated as such.<BR><BR>Andrew takes pride in providing the most professional and warming real estate transaction experiences for all of his clients; whether it be someone finding a rental home for the short term, finding the perfect home to purchase, or moving on from their existing home to bigger and better things. All of these clients are equally important, and all deserve the same level of professionalism and care. The aim to provide expert service during a real estate transaction while also treating the client as a friend whom has come to him to assist on one of their most important purchases, drives Andrew to continue to grow and learn with every new deal.<BR><BR>He hangs his license at Go Global Realty, where his broker and co-agents all work together to provide professional, courteous agency to their clients.",

      "about": "Cheri Ashton-Ludwig, Broker/Co-Owner. After years of retail work experience, I had to find a career that would enable me to enjoy providing excellence in customer service AND be able to spend quality time with my growing family! In 1998 I set out to get my real estate license and joined Apartment Search. This position allowed me the flexibility I needed and the opportunity to advance to management of their local offices. In September of 2004 Apartment Search began to downsize locations so Wendy and I ventured out on our own opening Complete Management Services. Finding the perfect rental to fit client needs, working with owners to fill vacancies, and limited property management has been a win-win situation. I have also recently obtained my Brokers License. Being a small business owner has allowed me to make my family top priority and help you spend more time with family and friends because of the service I am able to provide to you! cheria@completemanagementteam.com ",

In 2006, due to changes in the market, I began adding property management to my skills.  By 2009 I was doing property management full time.  I have honed my skills and relationships with vendors of all types.  In 2019 I opened my own management company. I have been a Bishop area resident since 1986. Married and raised my family here and have been enjoying the pleasures of being a grandparent and all that the Eastern Sierra area has to offer!<BR>I truly enjoy caring for homes and finding the best match in a tenant for the property.  Throughout my years I have stood on honesty, clear communication and respect! If we have those, we can work through anything!<BR>",

It has grown to currently managing hundreds of properties from 4 offices in 3 states and several cities and towns, with properties in urban and rural locations in Wyoming, Northern Colorado, Nebraska and California.<BR>We handle buy/sell transactions and are committed to maintaining properties in marketable condition. Our agreements cover various duties and responsibilities, such as inspecting the properties for preventative maintenance issues. This allows for budgeting and planning with the owners with regard to units in need of improvements. Leases, house rules, animal policy and other documents detail information leading to better compliance and less confusion with owners and tenants. We have an in house program covering therapy animal damage and loss of rent due to unemployment or family medical leave.

      "about": "There are many reasons why I enjoy helping people with their real estate needs. Perhaps the most obvious is the deep satisfaction that comes from helping people to realize their dreams, as well as helping them through the major transition that accompanies selling, buying, renting, and moving.<BR>Another reason is that real estate is a real learning process. No two clients are the same, no two listings are the same and no two deals are the same. Each has its own characteristics and challenges. However, it is particularly through overcoming the challenges that I learn the lessons that enable me to improve my quality of service.<BR>It is this ongoing commitment to first-class service that enables me to confidently say that if I can&#39;t answer a specific home-related question you have, I&#39;m a phone call or e-mail away from an expert in my professional network who can.<BR>So if you have any home-related questions or have been thinking about moving, or if you have any family, friends or neighbors, who would benefit from my experience and contacts, please don&#39;t hesitate to call or e-mail me.

      "about": "Chad earned his Accounting degree from West Virginia University before embarking on a career with Fortune 500 companies in the financial services and mortgage industries. In 2004, he transitioned into real estate, starting part-time with Century 21 in Columbus, Ohio. Just months later, Chad left his eight-year corporate tenure to pursue real estate full-time.<BR>After several successful years in Ohio, Chad moved to San Antonio, Texas, where he quickly fell in love with the city and its people. Motivated by a long-standing desire to own a real estate brokerage, he earned his Brokers license in 2009. Since co-owning Suburban Spaces, Chad has consistently ranked among the top 3% of sales agents in the San Antonio market, providing clients with exceptional service and helping them achieve their real estate goals.<BR>Chads professional expertise extends beyond his work as a broker. He served on the San Antonio Board of Realtors for three years, including a term on the MLS Committee for four years, where he also chaired the committee. His leadership and contributions have had a positive impact on the local real estate community.<BR>In addition to his real estate career, Chad is deeply committed to giving back to his community. He served as President of the San Antonio LGBT Chamber of Commerce, co-founded Project Fiesta to support local nonprofit organizations, and has dedicated over a decade to volunteering with Meals on Wheels.<BR>Chads primary motivation is to create an enjoyable, stress-free home buying and selling experience for his clients, building long-lasting relationships, earning repeat business, and generating referrals along the way.<BR>",

These standards have greatly aided her in her career as a professional property manager. After her father retired, her parents brought her to Colorado Springs in 1989. Mandy began her journey in real estate when she was 20 years old, starting out as a Receptionist. She soon worked her way up to Office Manager, and eventually obtained her real estate license to practice property management and sales. Once she became a property manager, she fell in love with it! She became a licensed agent in 2006 and brings those years of experience to the Dorman organization. She moved to beautiful Teller County, Colorado in 2004 and has lived there ever since. She looks forward to a long career in professional property management, and providing her clients and tenants with unsurpassed service! - See more at: http://www.coloradospringsproperty.management/about#sthash.GWwc5u4j.dpuf",

Buying homes as investments to flip or rent out are are just two of my passions.  I use my experience everyday to help a buyer understand from A to Z what the entire home buying process is really like.  Not just what they watch on HGTV.  I maintain my clients trust by always putting their best interests first and repeat business naturally follows.  Working with buyers, sellers and rental owners over the years has afforded me the opportunity to get to know so many people; many of which are now close personal friends.  Since about 50% of my client base is Spanish - no problem there as I am fluent in Spanish as well.",

This helps when doing property inspections or during maintenance calls so I can quickly differentiate between a true emergency and a simple repair man fix. Those who know me also know I never hesitate to get my hands dirty if need be! This helps me set up a plan to get the problem fixed quickly and efficiently.  I have also held a California Real Estate license since 2002 and have experience in all aspects of real estate. I am hard working, honest and will do what is necessary to ensure my clients expectations are exceeded.",

      "about": "Growing up in the shadow of an experienced entrepreneur, John witnessed firsthand the dedication and effort it took to successfully compete in real estate and development. In 2005, John moved from Long Island to Coxsackie and began working in the family business of construction and development. In 2009, the company shifted from an expansive 600-acre, fractional ownership project no longer suitable for the economy and purchased its first 4-unit apartment building in Catskill. Quickly applying similar layout methods and finishes implemented in developing east end homes on Long Island, coupled with fortuitous timing of downstate migration north, a new trajectory took off rapidly and came together as JMS Construction. The companys rapid success in renovation, construction supervision and property management was attained by continued streamlining of processes along with strategic acquisitions. John served as the companys Director of Operations and his responsibilities included logistics, inventory management, customer service, investor relations, construction supervision, property management, accounting, leasing and human resources on over 100 apartments.<BR><BR>Utilizing his experience and skills from JMS Construction, John was one of three partners that founded ProVest Management in 2013, focusing on managing commercial real estate development projects along the eastern seaboard beginning in Fort Valley, Georgia. Spearheading a team with locations in San Francisco, Dallas, India and NY, John was responsible for coordinating the property management of over 13 retail shopping centers with close to 1,000,000 sq ft of space. Notable centers managed include Springdale Plaza, Camden, South Carolina; North Towne Commons, Toledo, Ohio; Fort Valley Shopping Center, Fort Valley, Georg",

      "about": "As a Realtor with 12 years of experience, I love helping Buyers and Sellers fall in love with my hometown. Finding or selling a home is a life-changing experience, and I am truly honored to guide my clients through this journey. After more than 35 years in Santa Rosa County, Ive developed a deep connection with the area, from its most sought-after neighborhoods and schools to the lesser-known treasures that make it unique. My husband and I are proud parents of three incredible children who graduated from Pace High School and continued their education at Locklin Technical Institute and the University of West Florida. In my downtime, I enjoy baking, gardening, reading, and hanging out with my family and 95-pound lap dog. Im also an avid traveler, theater enthusiast, runner, and love exploring everything the Gulf Coast has to offer. Whether youre after a coffee shop recommendation, a date night spot, or the latest local real estate trends, I aim to be your go-to for all things local.<BR>",

      "about": "Tami Masuda has been involved with real estate for over 15 years.  She found selling real estate was not her cup of tea, though the money is better than in any other real estate field.<BR>Having tried to be an account manager for a management company, taking care of administration, and working with many association boards did not fully fulfill her.  However, she liked being exposed to the many facets of the job.  Having the opportunity to work as a general manager and seeing change from beginning to end was more challenging and rewarding.  But she found her niche in property management with the help of a long-time friend.  Property management satisfies her ability to communicate and work with owners and tenants of various personalities, beliefs, and backgrounds.<BR>She helps people with their investments and maintains their investments to the high standards she has while remaining true to herself and those she works with.",

      "about": "I grew up in Southern California and moved to Colorado in 2008. I started driving school busses in 2009 and then semi trucks by 2011. I was able to team drive with my husband of 10 years, Greg, and we covered a lot of road. It was an experience I was fortunate to have. I was still driving when the opportunity of becoming a property manager came up. The previous manager thought I would be good at it and I met with the owners in the 104 townhome complex and here I am. I wanted to make sure to join an organization that encourages, assists and teach how to be a better property manager.",
